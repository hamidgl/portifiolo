                        4.	My wife and I met in October 2013 in Korma, Sudan – with our relationship beginning at the same time when our parents agreed that we should be married; my wife and I are distant cousins, so it was arranged that we should be married. We were eventually married on 15th January 2014 in a traditional wedding with the blessing of both sets of our parents. It was very important to get the approval and blessing of my wife’s parents as she was 12 years old at the time, but this is allowed and accepted in my culture. 

                        5.	Our wedding was a traditional one. The ceremony took place over seventh days. The day before our wedding my wife had a henna party attended by all our female family members, friends, and neighbors. During this my wife had her henna done in preparation for our marriage. They also had lots of food and drink, such as, killed lamb, Aseda, and rice there was lots of music and dancing.
